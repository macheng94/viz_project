# Objectives of the project
#### a brief context of the project, and what tasks you're aiming to solve using visualizations, domain(target user) and task abstraction.
Many people are interested in the plants around the city. What the species they are? If the trees ara healthy? What about the years, maintanance and distribution of them? So we decided to plot all the trees in NYC.

What you can do in our visualization:

- 1.Select your address and understand the trees around you. 

- 2.Get the distribution for all kinds of New York Trees directly. 

- 3.Know the numbers of trees within each zip code area.

# Datasets involves

NYC Trees Distribution.      Link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/uvpi-gqnh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

NYC Zipcode Shapefile.       Link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Zip-Code-Boundaries/i8iw-xf4u

# Descriptions on your visualization design choices. For example, why you're choosing the types of visualization, representations, and/or interactions in your project.

The type of our visualization is Choropleth Geospatial Map & Distributing points


Representations:


Interactions:

- Users can select different species and know the distribution of that kind of trees in different zip code area. 
There is more trees in dark green area than in light green area.

- Users can make a selection on map as a circle with mobilable center and fragile edge, you can see the trees within the circle.


# Outcome and Evaluation: how did the visualization helps your users to achieve the objectives.

With our visualization, users can realize the distribution of every kind of trees in NYC by zip code. 
If you want to view the cherries in spring, you could easily know which zipcode area is most abundant with cherries.
And you can know the trees information around your address, just move the circle and select a proper edge.

# Visualization Tools Used
This data visualization uses D3.js, flask, altair, carto api, python.

# Possible future work
- add ability to show details of trees maintanance, years and healthy condition.
- add a chart bar to 
- combine with other demographic data.
